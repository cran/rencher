The goal of rencher is to …

## Installation

You can install the development version of rencher like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(rencher)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

``` r
summary(cars)
#>      speed           dist       
#>  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
#>  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
#>  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
#>  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
#>  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
#>  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

<img src="man/figures/README-pressure-1.png" width="100%" />

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.

## Dataset Description

This package provides a collection of datasets extracted from the book
“Methods of Multivariate Analysis” by Richard A. Johnson. The purpose of
compiling and making these datasets available is to assist students and
researchers in performing multivariate statistical analyses, including
MANOVA (Multivariate Analysis of Variance), with ease.

The datasets included in this package are specifically drawn from
various chapters of the book and contain exercises and examples
presented to help readers better understand the statistical concepts and
their real-world applications. This collection enables students to
enhance their skills in statistical analysis by working with real data
and exercises from the textbook.

These datasets are derived under the author’s guidance in the book, and
the primary goal is to provide easier access to the data and facilitate
the teaching and learning of complex statistical techniques for both
beginners and advanced learners in the field of statistics.
